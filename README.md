# IP-Routing-Trie-vs-List

Implemented a binary Trie-based IP lookup system for efficient prefix matching of IPv4 addresses.
Compared against a naive list-based lookup for insertion, search, and deletion operations.
Benchmarked performance on 2,000 random IPs â†’ Trie achieved ~X% faster lookups compared to the list approach.
Developed a modular Python implementation with performance reports and formatted output.
